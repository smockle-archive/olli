# Development Guide
So, you want to build an OLLI page. Someone pointed you here, saying, "Whoa, tiger.
Yours isn't as focused an energy as you think it is. Read this." Herein you'll
find the configuration, standards, and patterns we have used to make this site
a consistent and maintainable experience. Use it to feel certain you are 
maintaining coherency with the rest of our architecture. Use it to simplify
and break apart your thoughts. Use it to bring clarity and structure your efforts.

Use it to dev OLLI.
