Our system is separate from the rest of the University, so it is not required that a participant be a student in order to register. Also, Auburn University students/faculty/staff are not automatically included in our records.Click on the program that you are interested in and choose “Enroll Yourself” then “Create Account.”<h4 class="question">I’ve been an OLLI member before. How do I get a password?</h4>1) Past participants who have not registered online previously can enter the following:E‐mail Address Field: Type the e‐mail address that we have listed in our records. Password Field: Type the 1st letter of your first name (lowercase), the 1st letter of￼￼￼￼￼your last name (lowercase), then your zip code. This is considered your “temporary password.”For example: John Smith from Auburn, AL 36830 would type js36830 in the “Password” field.Once you type in your temporary password, you will be able to choose what youwant your permanent password to be.2) Past participants who have registered online previously and do not remembertheir password can do one of the following:a) Once you click “Enroll Yourself,” you will have the option to click “Forgot Password” and be e‐mailed a link that will allow you to change your permanent password.

If you are unable to attend a term for which you have already paid, notify the office before the term begins. All cancellation requests must be received in writing.OLLI Refund Guidelines.1. Membership dues of $25 are non‐refundable.2. No refunds after classes begin for a term with the exception for hardship cases,such as: relocation, death, illness (including illness of family member) or othercatastrophic event.3. If you are unable to attend a term for which you have already paid, we ask thatyou notify the office in writing before the term begins.4. If you pay for three terms and you are unable to attend, any refund will be basedon the cost per term amount. The same proration would occur if a participant paid for two terms and needed to cancel one of the terms.Example: Member pays academic fees for three terms at discounted rate of $200 plus $25 membership dues ($225 total). If the member drops to two terms the cost would be $165 two terms academic fees plus $25 membership dues or $190 total. Refund for cancelling one term is $25. If member drops to one term, the cost would be $115 one term academic fees plus $25 membership dues or $140 total. Refund for cancelling two terms is $50.5. Requests for refunds should be submitted in writing.<h4 class="question">How can I find out what courses I'm registered in or have taken?</h4>To see a list of courses in which you are enrolled or have attended, log in using your e‐ mail address and password.
